# KST_automated_mail.py

Used libraries : pandas,smtplib,MIMEMultipart,MIMEText 
created,imported,read csv containing emails with a heading of the column EMAIL
iterated all the emails and sent the emails one by one using smtp library using its corresponding port 587
used mimemultipart to divide the conetent into subject,body,text,attachment etc
and at last have quit smtp session.

challenges : 
1)VS code was not reading csv default format : we added utf-8 encoding format of csv and also enabled it in vs code so that it could read i without any interruption(We added utf-8 with our file name , and just at bottom right of vsCode we have UTF8 option click on that , the pop up comes and save the file.)
2)misinterpreted that , have to use the original email password : but actually we have to use the special app password generated by google account, for this go to google accounts and turn on two step verification , then open app passwords in security settings , then generate a new password for a sample app.(We wrote our original password , which is very wrong because code can be accessed with anyone . So to avoid data breaching we used google's apppassword(Link : https://myaccount.google.com/u/4/apppasswords) , which basically gave us the encyrpted version of password to write in our python script.)
